# Basic Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

## Aim
This repo contains all the machine learning projects done till now.
The results are not the best but it can be improved.
These ipynb files give an idea of we can preprocess the data, analyse it and apply ML models in order to do some awesome stuff.

## Description of each mini project

### Cancer Classification
This mini project uses the Winconsin breast cancer dataset. The tensorflow model used has 2 hidden ReLU activated layers and 1 sigmoid classification layer. The ADAM optimizer is used Early Stopping callback function is used. The accuracy obtained is 90 %.

### Tensorflow DNN Regressor for weather data
Tensorflow based DNN regressor is used to predict the weather conditions. 

### Image compression based on Vector Quantization
Vector quantization (VQ) is a classical quantization technique from signal processing that allows the modeling of probability density functions by the distribution of prototype vectors. Vector quantization is based on the competitive learning paradigm, so it is closely related to the self-organizing map model. This is highly useful for better image compression. This has been implemented in this program.

### Titanic Classification
This is the famous implementation of different classification methods viz Naive Bayes Classifier , SVM classifier , KNN classifier and XGB classifier for the Kaggle Titanic dataset.

### House Prediction
The solution to Kaggle house prediction challenge.

### K Means algorithm
An implementation to show K Means algo in action.

## Understanding
All the codes above are self explanatory and the jupyter notebooks are explained properly with comments
