# MLProjects

## Aim
This repo contains all the machine learning projects done till now.
The results are not the best but it can be improved.
These ipynb files give an idea of we can preprocess the data, analyse it and apply ML models in order to do some awesome stuff

## Description of each mini project

### Cancer Classification
This mini project uses the Winconsin breast cancer dataset. The tensorflow model used has 2 hidden ReLU activated layers and 1 sigmoid classification layer. The ADAM optimizer is used Early Stopping callback function is used. The accuracy obtained is 90 %.

### Tensorflow DNN Regressor for weather data
Tensorflow based DNN regressor is used to predict the weather conditions.
